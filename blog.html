            <h2>New Route to the Bomb Site!</h2>
            <p>Rush B no stop! New update for my latest creation de_alleyway. 
                The route to b-site has be drastically altered. It now goes into the sewers, 
                under the map. I was really unhappy with how the route was playing.
                The way to b-site should ironically be a straight shot to the site basically.</p>

            <h2>B Site Secure</h2>
            <p>It's been hard work getting B Site to feel good. I finally feel like that it's gotten to the point where 
                the bomb site plays how I want it to. That being two battles happeneing. One across the bridge over
                to the bomb site, and the other underneath. </p>

            <p>Not a lot of updates this week, mainly just working on Mid. I added a small porch for cover but I'll need to
                play test it to see how it works.
